# screen-capturer
This is a simple application built with electron and nodeJS to capture your screen or specific windows. I created this with the goals of being able to stream my entire screen on discord with audio and being able to watch videos or other windows over borderless games.

Currently I have implemented full desktop capturing and specific window capturing with an allways on top toggle.
In the future I would like to implement full audio support for both specific windows and full desktop.
